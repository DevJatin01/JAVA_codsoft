# Student Grades Calculator in Java

This repository contains a simple **Student Grades Calculator** built using Java.  
It was developed as a beginner-level project to understand how to use basic control structures, loops, arrays, and user input handling in Java.  
This project helps students strengthen core Java programming concepts and is ideal for those learning the language.

## 1. Project Overview

The program accepts marks input for **5 subjects** from the user. It then calculates:

- The **total marks** obtained.
- The **average percentage**.
- The **final grade** based on the percentage using a defined grading scale.

The logic uses arrays to store the marks, loops to calculate the sum, and if-else conditions to determine the grade.
